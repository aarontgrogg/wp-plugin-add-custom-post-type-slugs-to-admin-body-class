Add Custom Post Type Slugs to Admin `body` Class


== Description ==

When in Admin mode, this plug-in adds classes to the `<body>` tag to let
your CSS know where you are.

For example, if you are viewing the list of all your Posts, you would get this additional class:
`edit-list-post`
And, when you are editing a Post, something like this:
`edit-page-post`

Alternatively, for custom posts, for example "movie", you would see either:
`edit-list-movie`
or:
`edit-page-movie`

This allows you to write custom CSS and JS to interact with these varying edit pages within WP.

Please let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/thoughts,
